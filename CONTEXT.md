# Session Context - October 22, 2025

## Last Session Highlights

### ✅ Repository Synced & Smoke Tested
- Commit `0c800c49` pushed to `main`, capturing the full project tree so simulators pull the intended build.
- Manual `flutter run -d "iPhone 16"` launch verified the latest layout, Gemini initialization, and database boot logs (session dropped only after simulator idled).

### ✅ HomeScreen Tests Back to Green
- `flutter test test/screens/home_screen_test.dart` now passes all 22 cases; a residual hit-test warning remains and should be handled by scrolling before tapping the off-screen chip.
- Analyzer remains clean (`flutter analyze --no-pub`) against the synced commit.

### ✅ Shared UI Utilities in Place
- New `AppSnackBar` centralizes the glass-styled snackbar used by Verse Library, paywall, and future actions.
- Verse Library bottom sheet now aligns with the glass icon kit across the app.

### ✅ Verse Library History Actions Live
- Shared history is persisted via the new `shared_verses` table with Riverpod providers for counts and list rendering.
- Saved and shared tabs support per-entry delete plus clear-all flows; share actions from the reader bottom sheet log back into history.

## Outstanding Threads to Resume
1. **Paywall Flow Polish:** Rework `SubscriptionSettingsScreen` placing free-trial CTA and pricing card above the fold, remove the duplicated screen, and align snackbar messaging.
2. **UI Contrast + Feedback:** Update devotional reading-time pill color, audit other low-contrast badges, and smooth the splash → auth sizing transition.
3. **Gamification Metrics:** Decide whether to surface meaningful achievement stats on `ProfileScreen` or temporarily scale the module back.
4. **Share History QA:** Exercise shared-verse logging from additional entry points (e.g., Devotional cards) and confirm metadata/channel capture expectations.
5. **Expanded Test Coverage:** Plan a full `flutter test --coverage` run once current UI adjustments land; consider widget coverage for Verse Library bottom sheet flows.

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Current branch / remote
