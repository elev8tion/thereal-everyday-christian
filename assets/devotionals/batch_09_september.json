    "reflection": "We live in an age of information overload. With a few taps on a screen, you can access more facts than any generation in history. But information isn't wisdom. You can know a lot and still make foolish decisions. Wisdom is more than knowledge—it's the ability to apply truth to life. And according to Scripture, true wisdom begins with the fear of the Lord.\n\nThe fear of the Lord isn't terror or anxiety. It's reverence, awe, and recognition that God is God and you are not. It's the humility to admit you don't have all the answers and the trust to believe God does. When you approach life with this posture, something shifts. You stop relying solely on your own understanding. You start seeking God's perspective. You make decisions not based on what feels good, but on what aligns with His truth.\n\nJames tells us, 'If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God.' Wisdom isn't just for scholars or pastors—it's for you. For the decision you're facing at work. For the relationship that's confusing you. For the next step you're unsure about. God doesn't withhold wisdom from those who genuinely seek it. He gives it generously. Today, ask Him. Not for a sign or a miracle—just for wisdom. And then trust Him to provide it, one step at a time.",
    "lifeApplication": "Because God gives wisdom generously to those who ask, I will pray specifically for wisdom in the decision I'm facing and commit to following His leading even if it doesn't make sense to me.",
    "prayer": "God, I need Your wisdom. I don't trust my own understanding in this situation. Teach me to fear You—to reverence Your ways above my own. Give me discernment to know truth from deception, and courage to follow Your leading even when it's hard. Thank You for Your promise to give wisdom to those who ask. Amen.",
    "actionStep": "Before making any decision today, pause and ask: 'Does this align with Scripture? Would this bring glory to God? What would wise counsel say?' Write down your reflections.",

    "reflection": "Discipline has a bad reputation. It sounds restrictive, joyless, harsh. But biblical discipline is actually an expression of love. God disciplines those He loves, not to punish but to protect and mature. And self-discipline—the ability to say no to what you want in the moment for the sake of what you want most—is a gift that leads to freedom, not bondage.\n\nThe writer of Hebrews says, 'No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace.' The key word is 'later.' Discipline requires delayed gratification. It's choosing the long-term reward over the short-term pleasure. It's getting up early to pray when you'd rather sleep. It's choosing forgiveness when you'd rather hold a grudge. It's doing the right thing even when no one is watching.\n\nHere's the truth: discipline isn't about becoming a robot who never makes mistakes. It's about aligning your habits with your values. It's about training yourself to respond to life in a way that honors God and blesses others. And the beauty of discipline is this—it gets easier with practice. Every small act of obedience builds spiritual muscle. Every no to sin makes the next no a little easier. Today, choose one area where you need more discipline. And ask God for the grace to take the next small step.",
    "lifeApplication": "Because discipline leads to righteousness and peace, I will establish one new spiritual discipline this week and practice it consistently, relying on God's grace.",
    "prayer": "Father, I confess I lack discipline. I give in too easily to what feels good in the moment, and I neglect what's best for my soul. Transform me from the inside out. Give me the Holy Spirit's power to practice self-control and develop godly habits. I can't do this without You. In Jesus' name, amen.",
    "actionStep": "Choose one spiritual discipline to practice this week (prayer, Scripture reading, fasting, silence). Put it on your calendar like any other appointment and treat it as non-negotiable.",
