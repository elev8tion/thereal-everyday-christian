  🔴 PRIORITY 0: CRITICAL DATABASE ISSUES

  Issue #1: Table Naming Confusion ⚠️ BLOCKING

  Severity: HIGHImpact: Code references wrong table name, causing runtime errors

  Problem:
  - assets/bible.db uses table name: verses
  - Some services reference: bible_verses

  Evidence:
  # Database schema shows:
  CREATE TABLE verses (id, book, chapter, verse_number, text, translation, reference, themes, clean_text)

  # But these files reference "bible_verses":
  - lib/core/services/verse_service.dart (line 12, 24, 46)
  - lib/core/services/database_service.dart
  - lib/services/unified_verse_service.dart

  Solution:
  1. Option A (Recommended): Rename all code references from bible_verses → verses
    - Update lib/core/services/verse_service.dart
    - Update lib/services/unified_verse_service.dart
    - Run tests to verify
  2. Option B: Rename database table from verses → bible_verses
    - Requires database migration
    - More risky, could break Bible loading

  Effort: 1-2 hoursPriority: P0 - Fix before shipping

  Issue #2: Duplicate VerseService Files ⚠️ CONFUSING

  Severity: HIGHImpact: Two different implementations, maintainability nightmare

  Found:
  1. lib/services/verse_service.dart (51+ lines)
    - Uses verses table (correct!)
    - Implements FTS5 full-text search
    - Has fallback search logic
  2. lib/core/services/verse_service.dart (50+ lines)
    - Uses bible_verses table (wrong!)
    - Also implements FTS5 search
    - Different method signatures

  Recommendation:
  - Keep: lib/services/verse_service.dart (queries correct table)
  - Delete or merge: lib/core/services/verse_service.dart
  - Update imports across the codebase

  Effort: 2-3 hoursPriority: P0 - Consolidate immediately

  ---
  Issue #3: Missing Database Indexes

  Severity: MEDIUMImpact: Slower search performance

  Current Indexes:
  idx_book_chapter    -- Good!
  idx_reference       -- Good!
  idx_book            -- Good!

  Missing Indexes:
  CREATE INDEX idx_translation ON verses(translation);  -- Filter by version
  CREATE INDEX idx_verse_number ON verses(verse_number);  -- Range queries

  Effort: 15 minutesPriority: P1 - Add before performance testing

  🗑️ PRIORITY 1: PROJECT CLUTTER (2.6GB!)

  Clutter Breakdown:

  | Directory/File | Size  | Can Delete? | Impact                                 |
  |----------------|-------|-------------|----------------------------------------|
  | training/venv/ | 1.1GB | ✅ YES       | Python dependencies (TensorFlow, etc.) |
  | ios/           | 1.5GB | ⚠️ PARTIAL  | Contains CocoaPods (needed for builds) |
  | build/         | 739MB | ✅ YES       | Build artifacts (regenerated on build) |
  | training/*.log | 1.3MB | ✅ YES       | Old training logs                      |
  | coverage/      | 1.9MB | ⚠️ KEEP     | Test coverage reports                  |

  Cleanup Commands:
  # Safe to delete (saves ~2GB):
  rm -rf training/venv
  rm -rf build
  rm -f training/*.log
  rm -f ios_shape_fix.txt
  rm -f migrate_design_system.py
  rm -f diagnose.sh

  # Add to .gitignore if not already:
  training/venv/
  build/
  *.log

  Effort: 5 minutesPriority: P1 - Clean before committing

  Issue #4: 28 Background Flutter Processes! 🔥

  Severity: HIGHImpact: Draining system resources, potential port conflicts

  Evidence:
  28 background bash shells running flutter run commands!

  Fix:
  # Kill all background Flutter processes:
  pkill -f "flutter run"

  # Or kill specific shells:
  ps aux | grep "flutter run" | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill

  Effort: 1 minutePriority: P0 - Do this NOW

  Issue #5: Root Directory Clutter

  Files cluttering root:
  - Christian-AI-Training-Data-Spec-Driven-Plan.md (33KB)
  - Pastoral-Guidance-75-Themes-Spec-Driven-Plan.md (60KB)
  - EVERYDAY-CHRISTIAN-AI-MASTER-PLAN.md (28KB)
  - CLOUDFLARE_MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md
  - DEPLOYMENT.md
  - test_cloudflare_integration.sh
  - run_with_env.sh

  Recommendation:
  Move to docs/planning/ folder:
  mkdir -p docs/planning
  mv *-Plan.md docs/planning/
  mv CLOUDFLARE_MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md docs/archive/
  mv DEPLOYMENT.md docs/

  Effort: 5 minutesPriority: P2 - Nice to have

  📁 PROJECT STRUCTURE ANALYSIS

  Current Structure: GOOD

  lib/
  ├── core/                    ✅ Good separation
  │   ├── database/           ✅ 10 migration files
  │   ├── services/           ✅ 17 services
  │   ├── providers/          ✅ Riverpod providers
  │   ├── models/             ✅ Freezed models
  │   └── navigation/         ✅ Navigation service
  ├── features/               ✅ Feature-based organization
  │   ├── auth/              ✅ Auth services
  │   └── chat/              ⚠️ Could have more features
  ├── screens/                ✅ 15 screens
  ├── widgets/                ✅ Reusable widgets
  ├── services/               ⚠️ DUPLICATE OF core/services!
  └── l10n/                   ✅ Localization

  Architectural Issues:

  1. Duplicate service folders:
    - lib/core/services/ (17 files) ← Correct location
    - lib/services/ (11 files) ← Should be moved to core/services/
  2. Mixed responsibilities:
    - Some services in core/, others in root services/
    - AI services should be in features/ai/services/

  🎯 CODE QUALITY ASSESSMENT

  Largest Files (Potential Complexity Issues):

  | File                       | Lines | Assessment                              |
  |----------------------------|-------|-----------------------------------------|
  | app_error.freezed.dart     | 3,076 | ⚠️ Generated file (OK)                  |
  | app_localizations.dart     | 1,537 | ⚠️ Generated file (OK)                  |
  | prayer_journal_screen.dart | 1,060 | 🔴 Too large! Should split into widgets |
  | reading_plan_screen.dart   | 1,056 | 🔴 Too large! Should split into widgets |
  | home_screen.dart           | 885   | 🟡 Getting large                        |
  | chat_screen.dart           | 865   | 🟡 Getting large                        |

  Recommendations:

  - Split large screens into smaller widget files
  - Extract repeated UI patterns into reusable components
  - Target: Keep screens under 500 lines
