Everyday Christian: is designed to help you bridge the gap between Sunday worship and your daily life. Whether you are a new believer or have walked with Christ for years, our app provides the tools you need to stay rooted in Scripture and consistent in prayer amidst the busyness of modern life.

Why Everyday Christian? Life is busy. It’s easy for our spiritual lives to take a backseat to work, family, and daily chores. We built Everyday Christian to make it simple, accessible, and encouraging to pause and focus on what truly matters.
