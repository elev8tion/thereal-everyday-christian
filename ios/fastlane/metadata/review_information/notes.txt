We have addressed all three rejection issues from the previous submission:

1. GUIDELINE 3.1.2 - Missing Subscription Information:
We have updated the app binary to include ALL required information as specified:
- Subscription length: "12 months of access" (yearly) and "1 month of access" (monthly) are now displayed prominently on plan cards
- Price: $35.99/year and $5.99/month displayed in large, bold text
- Content/Services: "150 Scripture Chats per month" badge, AI-powered Bible study features
- Functional links to Privacy Policy (https://everydaychristian.app/privacy) and Terms of Use (https://everydaychristian.app/terms) are now positioned directly below the Subscribe button in a prominent frosted glass card with gold text that opens in Safari

2. GUIDELINE 2.1 - Locating In-App Purchases:
The in-app purchases are fully functional and accessible via three paths:
   Method 1 (Direct): Home → Menu → Settings → "Manage Subscription"
   Method 2: Home → "My Prayers" → Add Prayer → "Get AI Guidance" → (use 15 messages)
   Method 3: Home → "Scripture Chat" → (use 15 messages)
Product IDs are correctly configured for sandbox testing:
   - everyday_christian_premium_yearly
   - everyday_christian_premium_monthly

3. GUIDELINE 2.3.8 - App Name Mismatch:
The app binary has been completely cleaned and rebuilt. CFBundleDisplayName is set to "Everyday Christian" to match the App Store marketing name. The old "EDC Faith" name has been eliminated.

All changes have been tested on physical iOS devices in sandbox environment.

Build 22 is ready for review.
