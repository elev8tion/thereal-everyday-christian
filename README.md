## 🛡️ Privacy & Security

### Privacy-First Design

**Unlike other religious apps, we don't monetize your spiritual journey.**

In recent years, major faith apps have faced scandals:
- Pray.com suffered data breaches exposing millions of users
- Muslim Pro sold user location data to military contractors
- Popular apps mine prayers as "business assets" for data brokers

**Everyday Christian is different:**

### What We DON'T Collect
- ❌ **No user accounts** - download and use immediately, no sign-up required
- ❌ **No authentication data** - we never see your device PIN or biometric data
- ❌ **No personal information** - no emails, names, phone numbers, or profiles
- ❌ **No location tracking** - we don't track where you pray or worship
- ❌ **No user analytics** - we don't monitor your behavior or app usage
- ❌ **No data monetization** - your prayers are never sold to data brokers
- ❌ **No social features** - no sharing that could expose your spiritual struggles

### What Stays On Your Device
- ✅ **All Bible verses** - 31,103 verses stored locally (works offline)
- ✅ **All prayers** - your prayer journal stays on your device
- ✅ **All favorites & bookmarks** - stored in local SQLite database
- ✅ **All settings & preferences** - stored locally with SharedPreferences
- ✅ **All reading history** - never leaves your phone

### Third-Party Services
- ⚠️ **AI Chat uses Google Gemini API** - when you use the AI chat feature, your messages are sent to Google's servers for AI processing. Google may collect: message content, IP address, and timestamps. However, we do NOT send any user identifier, account info, or link messages to your identity. Each request is anonymous from your perspective.

### Security Features
- 🔐 **OS-native authentication** - Uses your device's PIN, Face ID, or Touch ID
- 🚫 **No user accounts** - No passwords to remember or data to breach
- 🔓 **Privacy-first lockout** - After 3 wrong attempts, use device auth to unlock (no account bans)
- 🔒 **Secure local storage** - FlutterSecureStorage for sensitive data
- 🛡️ **Crisis detection** - Built-in safeguards for mental health emergencies
- ⚠️ **Content filtering** - Automatic detection of harmful theology

### Your Data, Your Control
- **No cloud sync** means no data breach risk from our servers (we don't have any)
- **No account** means no password to leak or credentials to steal
- **Uninstall = complete deletion** - all data removed when you delete the app
