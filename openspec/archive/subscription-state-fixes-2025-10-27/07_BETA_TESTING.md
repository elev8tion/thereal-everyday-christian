# TestFlight Beta Testing Plan

**Priority:** P1 (Critical before public launch, not blocking submission)
**Est. Time:** 2-3 weeks (1 week recruitment + 2 weeks testing)

**Beta Goals:**
1. Find and fix critical bugs before public launch
2. Validate UX (onboarding, navigation, features)
3. Test AI responses with real users
4. Verify subscription flow works end-to-end
5. Gather testimonials for App Store description

**Timeline:**
- Week 1: Recruit 10 testers
- Week 2-3: Beta testing (active feedback collection)
- Week 4: Bug fixes and final polish
