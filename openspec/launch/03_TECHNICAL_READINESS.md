---

## 🔒 Security Audit Checklist

### API Key Security (P0)

- [ ] **Environment Variables Protection**
  - API keys stored in `.env` file (NOT committed to git)
  - `.env` listed in `.gitignore`
  - Verify: `git log --all -- .env` returns nothing
  - Production keys different from development keys

- [ ] **Google AI API Key**
  - Location: `assets/.env` → `GEMINI_API_KEY`
  - Loaded via `flutter_dotenv` package (pubspec.yaml:65)
  - Key has IP/domain restrictions in Google Cloud Console
  - Usage quotas configured to prevent abuse
  - Test: Confirm key works in production build

- [ ] **API Key Obfuscation**
  ```bash
  # Check that .env is NOT in version control
  git ls-files | grep -i "\.env"  # Should return nothing

  # Check for hardcoded secrets
  grep -r "AIza" lib/ --exclude-dir=.git  # Should return nothing
  ```

**Action Items:**
1. Add `.env` to `.gitignore` if not already present
2. Configure API key restrictions in Google Cloud Console
3. Set up billing alerts for AI API usage
4. Document key rotation procedure

---

### Data Encryption (P0)

- [ ] **At-Rest Encryption**
  - SQLite database: Native iOS encryption (no additional action needed)
  - SharedPreferences: Native iOS keychain (secure by default)
  - Secure storage: Using `flutter_secure_storage: ^9.0.0` (pubspec.yaml:25)
  - Verify: User data encrypted when device locked

- [ ] **Sensitive Data Protection**
  ```dart
  // Files to audit:
  // lib/features/auth/services/secure_storage_service.dart - Biometric data
  // lib/core/services/database_service.dart - Prayer journal, chat history
  // lib/core/services/preferences_service.dart - User settings
  ```
  - Prayer journal: Stored in encrypted SQLite
  - Chat history: Stored in encrypted SQLite
  - User profile picture: Stored in app documents (iOS sandboxed)
  - No sensitive data in logs or analytics

- [ ] **Data Deletion Verification**
  - "Delete All Data" completely removes user data (settings_screen.dart:1376-1431)
  - Test: Delete data → Check file system → No residual files
  - Test: Uninstall app → Reinstall → No data persists (unless subscription restored)

**Action Items:**
1. Audit all database queries for proper encryption
2. Test data deletion on physical device
3. Verify no sensitive data logged in production

---

  // File: lib/services/ai_service.dart
  ```
