# Subscription & Trial Flow Testing

**Priority:** P0 (Critical business logic - must work perfectly)
**Est. Time:** 2-3 days (includes automated + manual testing)
**Owner:** Developer + QA Tester

---

## 🎯 Overview

The subscription model is the core revenue driver. **Every edge case must be tested** to prevent:
- Revenue loss (trial abuse, failed purchases)
- User frustration (incorrect limits, failed restores)
- App Store rejection (non-compliant subscription handling)

**Business Model:**
- 3-day trial: 15 messages total (15 total)
- Premium: $34.99/year, 150 messages/month
- Auto-renewable subscription via App Store

---

## 🚨 Critical Bugs to Watch For

### High Severity
1. **Trial Reset Bug**: User can delete data → get infinite trials
   - Status: Known issue (fix in roadmap Phase 1)
   - Impact: Revenue loss, unfair usage

2. **Message Counter Race Condition**: Rapid taps send >5 messages
   - Test: Tap send button 10 times rapidly
   - Fix: Debounce send button, check limit before AND after send

3. **Subscription Not Restored**: Delete data → lose premium status
   - Test: Test Case 9
   - Fix: Call `restorePurchases()` in `initialize()`

### Medium Severity
4. **Expiry Date Not Tracked**: Subscription expires but user keeps access
   - Test: Test Case 13
   - Fix: Extract `expires_date` from receipt, check on init

5. **Monthly Reset Edge Case**: Message sent at 11:59 PM doesn't count
   - Test: Test Case 11 (midnight boundary)
   - Fix: Use UTC dates, proper timezone handling
