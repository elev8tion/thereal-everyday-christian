**Estimated Time:** 8-12 hours
**Budget:** $0 (DIY with free tools)

## What is ASO? (For Beginners)

**ASO = SEO for App Stores**

Just like Google SEO helps people find your website, ASO helps people find your app in the App Store.

**The Problem:**
- 5+ million apps in App Store
- 70% of users find apps through search
- If your ASO is bad ‚Üí Your app is invisible

**The Solution:**
- Optimize your app name, keywords, screenshots, and description
- Show up in search results for "bible app", "prayer journal", "christian chat"
- Get organic (free) downloads without paid ads

**Example:**
```
Bad ASO: "Everyday Christian" (vague, no keywords)
Good ASO: "Everyday Christian - Bible, Prayer & AI Chat" (clear, searchable)
```

---

## ASO Impact on Downloads

**Real-World Example:**
```
Week 1 (No ASO): 5 downloads/day
Week 2 (With ASO): 50 downloads/day
Week 4 (Optimized ASO + Reviews): 200 downloads/day
```

**Why It Matters for Everyday Christian:**
- Your app has unique features (AI chat, KJV + Spanish Bible, prayer journal)
- Competitors (YouVersion, Bible Gateway) dominate generic keywords
- ASO helps you rank for niche keywords:
  - "AI bible study"
  - "prayer journal app"
  - "christian ai chat"
  - "bilingual bible kjv rvr"

- **Design:** Simple, recognizable at small sizes
- **Content:** No text (Apple guideline), clear imagery
- **Format:** RGB color space (not CMYK)

### 2. App Name (30 Characters Max)

**Status:** [ ] Not Started / [ ] In Progress / [ ] Completed

**Rules:**
- **Max 30 characters** (including spaces)
- **Most important for search ranking** (weighted higher than keywords)
- **Include primary keyword** if possible
- **Must be unique** (no copying competitors)

**Examples:**

‚ùå **Too Generic:**
```
"Everyday Christian"
(Only 18 characters, but no keywords ‚Üí bad ASO)
```

‚úÖ **Optimized Options:**
```
"Everyday Christian - Bible" (27 chars)
"Everyday Christian - Prayer" (28 chars)
"Everyday Christian - AI Chat" (29 chars)
```

‚úÖ **Best Option (Recommended):**
```
"Everyday Christian - Bible AI" (30 chars exactly)
```
Why: Includes "Bible" (high search volume) + "AI" (unique differentiator)

**Research Your Name:**
- [ ] Search App Store for similar names (avoid copycats)
- [ ] Check trademark conflicts (search USPTO.gov)
- [ ] Verify name isn't offensive/misleading

**Decision:**
Final app name: _________________________________

---

### 3. Subtitle (30 Characters Max)

**Status:** [ ] Not Started / [ ] In Progress / [ ] Completed

**Rules:**
- **Max 30 characters**

```
"Prayer, Study & Scripture Chat" (30 chars)
"KJV Bible, Prayer & AI Pastor" (29 chars)
"Daily Bible Study & AI Guidance" (31 chars - 1 too long)
```

‚úÖ **Recommended:**
```
"Prayer, Study & AI Chat" (23 chars)
```

**Decision:**
Final subtitle: _________________________________

---

kjv, journal, daily, verse, worship, study
```

**Unique Keywords (Low Volume, High Intent):**

```

**Keyword Formula (100 characters):**

(97 characters - 3 left for optimization)
```
