# TestFlight Build 11 - Testing Guide (Nov 5, 2025)

## CRITICAL - Test These First

1. LONG-PRESS VERSE INTERACTION
Go to Bible, open any chapter, long-press verse for 1 second. Icons animate in, text turns gold. Tap icon or dismiss by tapping elsewhere. Is 1 second hold time right? Does gold text provide clear feedback?

2. VERSE TUTORIAL TOOLTIP
Fresh install, go to Bible, open chapter. See "Press & hold verse for actions" tooltip with down arrow above first verse. Tap to dismiss. Does it reappear on reopen (should NOT)? Is message clear? Visible against frosted glass?

3. BRANDED SHARING
Verse Library: 3-dot menu, Share as Image. Devotional: 3-dot menu, Share Devotional. Is QR code scannable? Image professional? Would you share it?

## HIGH PRIORITY

4. ONBOARDING WITH AI CHAT DEMO
Fresh install, watch onboarding flow with ripple animation. Does it explain app value? Chat demo convincing? Too long/short?

5. FAB MENU TOOLTIP
Fresh install, home screen shows pulsing "Tap here to explore" above FAB. Tap FAB to dismiss forever. Helpful or annoying?

6. NEW READING PLANS (10+ total)
Check Reading Plans screen for: Gospel of John (21 days), Proverbs (31 days), Psalms for Prayer (30 days), 30 Days of Grace, Finding Peace in Anxiety, Advent Journey, Identity in Christ. Do they load correctly?

7. 424 DEVOTIONALS
Daily Devotional, scroll through Nov 2025 to Dec 2026. Jump to random dates. Any formatting issues?

## MEDIUM PRIORITY

8. DARKGLASSCONTAINER REDESIGN
Unified frosted glass design in Prayer Journal, Verse Library, Reading Plans, 3-dot menus, Bible browser. App feel more cohesive? Gold border too subtle?

9. DEVOTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS
8-section structure, monthly progress calendar, tap verse references to open Bible. Layout overwhelming? Navigation clear?

10. PROFILE ACHIEVEMENTS
Achievement cards for 10 prayer requests, 50 verses saved, 7-day reading streak, 10 conversations shared. Motivating? Gamification appropriate?

11. BIBLE GRID LAYOUT
Old/New Testament tabs with grid of book cards. Easier to find books? Prefer grid or list?

## BUG FIXES TO VERIFY

12. Devotional date navigation works
13. Profile name deletion persists across restarts
14. Chat input floats properly over long messages
15. No unexpected onboarding navigation

## KEY QUESTIONS
