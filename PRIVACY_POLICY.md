# EVERYDAY CHRISTIAN - PRIVACY POLICY

*Last Updated: October 15, 2025*
*Effective Date: October 15, 2025*

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Everyday Christian ("we," "our," "us," or the "App"). We are deeply committed to your privacy and have built this application on a **privacy-first foundation**. This Privacy Policy explains our data practices for the Everyday Christian mobile application.

Everyday Christian is a faith-centered mobile app that provides:
- AI-powered pastoral guidance using Google Gemini 2.0 Flash (Premium feature)
- Daily Bible verses and devotionals
- Personal prayer journal
- Comprehensive verse library (31,103 verses from the World English Bible)
- Bible reading plans
- Crisis intervention resources

**Our Privacy-First Commitment:**
- **NO user accounts required** - use the app completely anonymously
- **NO personal information collection** - we don't ask for names, emails, or phone numbers
- **NO location tracking** - we never access your GPS or location data
- **NO third-party analytics or tracking** - we don't use Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, or similar tracking services
- **NO advertising networks** - we don't integrate ad networks or sell ad space
- **NO data monetization** - we never sell or rent your information
- **Local-first storage** - all your data stays on your device using secure SQLite database

**By using Everyday Christian, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.**

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Information Stored Locally on Your Device

All of the following data is stored **exclusively on your device** using SQLite database technology protected by your device's security and **never leaves your device** except when using the Premium AI chat feature:

**Prayer Journal Entries**: Your personal prayers, prayer requests, prayer categories, and reflections that you choose to save. Includes prayer status (answered, pending, ongoing), timestamps, and optional notes.

**Favorite Verses**: Bible verses you mark as favorites for quick access, including verse text, biblical reference, personal notes, tags, and date added.

**Reading History**: Which Bible chapters and verses you've read to track your reading progress through the 31,103 verses in the World English Bible translation.

**Reading Plan Progress**: Your progress through selected Bible reading plans, including completion dates and chapter tracking.

**Verse Bookmarks**: Bookmarked verses with personal notes, tags, creation timestamps, and last updated timestamps.

**AI Chat History** (Premium users only): Conversations with the AI pastoral guidance system, stored locally on your device with session IDs, message timestamps, and conversation metadata.

**Daily Verses**: Track which daily verses have been delivered to you, whether you've opened them, and whether notifications were sent.

**App Settings**: Your preferences including theme selection, text size, notification preferences, font size for Bible reader, biometric authentication preferences, and other customization options stored in a local settings table.

**Devotional Progress**: Which daily devotionals you've completed and when.

### 2.2 Information We Do NOT Collect

We have intentionally designed Everyday Christian to respect your privacy by **NOT** collecting:

- ❌ Personal identification (name, email, phone number)
- ❌ User accounts or login credentials
- ❌ Location data or GPS coordinates
- ❌ Device tracking identifiers for advertising
- ❌ Behavioral analytics or usage tracking
- ❌ Contacts, photos, or other device data
- ❌ Payment information (handled by Apple/Google payment systems)
- ❌ Social media connections or profiles
- ❌ IP addresses or network information

### 2.3 Third-Party Service: Google Gemini API

**Premium AI Chat Feature Only**: When you use the Premium AI pastoral guidance feature (150 messages/month, approximately $35/year subscription (pricing varies by region)), your chat messages are sent to Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash API to generate biblically-grounded responses.

**Important details:**
- **Anonymous requests**: We do not include your name, email, device ID, or any personal identifiers when sending messages to Google
- **Session-based context**: Within a single conversation session, recent message history is included with each request to maintain conversational context (e.g., "you mentioned earlier..."). This allows the AI to provide coherent, contextual guidance.
- **No cross-session tracking**: Unlike chat services with user accounts (like ChatGPT), we cannot and do not track your conversations across different sessions. Each new conversation you start on a different day appears as a completely separate, anonymous interaction. Even if you have 100 conversations over a year, there is no technical way for Google or us to link them together or build a long-term profile of you.
- **Trained AI model**: Our system includes pastoral training examples based on authentic biblical counseling to guide appropriate Christian responses
- **Google's data use**: Google processes your message text according to their API terms and may use it to improve their services. See Google's Generative AI Prohibited Use Policy: https://policies.google.com/terms/generative-ai/use-policy
- **Content filtering**: AI-generated responses are automatically filtered for harmful theology patterns including prosperity gospel, spiritual bypassing, toxic positivity, legalism, hate speech, and inappropriate medical advice. Filtered responses are replaced with safe, scripture-based alternatives.
- **Crisis detection**: User messages containing crisis keywords (suicide, self-harm, abuse) trigger immediate intervention with professional resources including the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline

**Free tier users**: If you don't subscribe to Premium, you can use all other app features without any data leaving your device.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

### 3.1 Local Data Usage (On Your Device)

The data stored locally on your device is used to:

**Provide Core Features**: Display your prayer journal, favorite verses, reading history, and AI chat conversations within the app

**Personalize Your Experience**: Remember your settings, track reading progress, and suggest relevant reading plans based on your history

**Maintain Reading Streaks**: Track daily devotional completion and reading plan adherence

**Secure Your Data**: Enable biometric authentication (Face ID, Touch ID, fingerprint) to protect your personal spiritual content if you choose to enable this feature

**No external transmission**: This local data is never sent to our servers or any third party

### 3.2 Third-Party Data Processing (Google Gemini API - Premium Only)

When you use the Premium AI chat feature:

**Generate Pastoral Responses**: Your message text is sent anonymously to Google Gemini API to generate biblically-grounded guidance with scripture references

**Crisis Intervention**: Messages containing crisis indicators trigger safety protocols, though the detection happens locally on your device before any API call

**Content Moderation**: Messages are filtered locally for policy violations (prosperity gospel, hate speech) before being processed

**Google's Use**: Google may use your message text according to their Generative AI terms to improve their API services

### 3.3 Subscription Management

**Payment Processing**: Handled entirely by Apple App Store or Google Play Store payment systems. We never see or store your payment information.

**Subscription Status**: Your device communicates with Apple/Google servers to verify your Premium subscription status, but we do not receive personal identifying information from these transactions.

### 3.4 Security Lockout System

**Content Policy Enforcement**: If you enter an incorrect pastoral guidance PIN or violate our content policies (hate speech, prosperity gospel, harassment), the app implements a privacy-first security system:
- **3 incorrect attempts = 30-minute temporary lockout**
- **Device authentication bypass**: You can immediately bypass the lockout using your device's built-in authentication (PIN, fingerprint, or Face ID)
- **Privacy-preserving**: We do not see, store, or have access to your device authentication credentials - this is handled entirely by your device's operating system
- **Local-only data**: Only two integers are stored locally (attempt counter and lockout timestamp) - no accounts, usernames, or personal identifiers
- Other app features (Bible reading, prayer journal, etc.) remain accessible during lockout
- **Zero data transmission**: No authentication data ever leaves your device

## 4. Data Storage and Security

### 4.1 Local Storage Architecture

**All personal data** - including prayer journal entries, AI chat history, favorite verses, reading history, and app settings - is stored **exclusively on your device** using:

**SQLite Database**: Secure local database technology that stores your data in the app's protected storage area, safeguarded by your device's built-in security

**Biometric Security (Optional)**: You can enable Face ID, Touch ID, or fingerprint authentication to add an additional security layer before accessing sensitive features

**No Cloud Storage**: We do not sync your data to any cloud service, external server, or backup system. Your spiritual journey remains private on your device.

**App Sandbox**: The data is isolated within the app's secure container and cannot be accessed by other apps on your device

### 4.2 Data Security Measures

We implement industry-standard security practices:

**Secure Coding Standards**: Development follows OWASP Mobile Security Guidelines to prevent common vulnerabilities

**Device-Level Protection**: All app data is protected by your device's built-in security features, including full-disk encryption available on modern iOS and Android devices

**Secure API Communication**: When using Premium AI chat, messages are transmitted to Google Gemini API over TLS/SSL encrypted connections

**No User Credentials**: Since we don't use accounts, there are no passwords to be compromised

**Regular Security Reviews**: We conduct periodic security audits of our codebase and data handling

**Crisis Content Handling**: Crisis detection keywords are processed locally on your device and never logged or transmitted

**Important**: No system is 100% secure. While we implement strong protections, you should be aware that any data stored on your device could potentially be accessed if your device is compromised, lost, or stolen. We recommend:
- Using device-level passcode/biometric protection
- Enabling app-level biometric authentication in Settings
- Being cautious about device sharing

### 4.3 Device Backups

**iCloud Backup (iOS)**: If you enable iCloud backup on your iOS device, your locally stored app data (including prayer journal and chat history) may be included in your iCloud backups. This is controlled by Apple's backup settings and governed by Apple's Privacy Policy.

**Google Drive Backup (Android)**: If you enable Android device backup, app data may be included in your Google Drive backups per Google's Privacy Policy.

**To exclude Everyday Christian from backups**:
- iOS: Settings > [Your Name] > iCloud > Manage Storage > Backups > [Device] > Toggle off Everyday Christian
- Android: Settings > Google > Backup > Toggle off app data for Everyday Christian

**We recommend**: If you have particularly sensitive spiritual content, consider disabling app backups for Everyday Christian and manually clearing data before device transfers.

## 5. Data Sharing and Disclosure

### 5.1 We Do Not Sell Your Data

**We categorically do not and will never:**
- Sell your personal information to third parties
- Rent or lease your data to advertisers or marketers
- Share your data with data brokers
- Use your spiritual content for advertising purposes
- Monetize your prayers, Bible reading, or chat conversations

**We have no business model based on data monetization.** Our only revenue comes from optional Premium subscriptions (approximately $35/year).

### 5.2 Third-Party Data Sharing

**Google Gemini API (Premium AI Chat Only)**:
- **What is shared**: Your message text only (when you send an AI chat message)
- **What is NOT shared**: Your name, email, device ID, location, or any identifiers
- **Purpose**: To generate AI-powered pastoral guidance responses
- **Google's use**: Google may use message text to improve their AI services per their terms
- **User control**: Don't subscribe to Premium if you prefer zero third-party data sharing

**Apple App Store / Google Play Store**:
- **What is shared**: Subscription purchase information (handled by Apple/Google)
- **Purpose**: Process Premium subscription payments and verify subscription status
- **Our access**: We receive only anonymous subscription validation; we do not see your payment details or personal information

**NO other third-party services** access your data. We do not use:
- Analytics platforms (e.g., Google Analytics, Mixpanel)
- Advertising networks
- Crash reporting services with personal data
- Cloud storage providers
- Social media integrations

### 5.3 Legal Requirements and Safety

**We may disclose information when required by law or to prevent harm:**

**Legal Obligations**: We will comply with valid subpoenas, court orders, or legal processes. Since nearly all data is stored locally on your device, we have very limited information to provide to authorities.

**Crisis Intervention**: If we implement server-side crisis detection in the future, we may report imminent threats of self-harm or harm to others to appropriate authorities. Currently, crisis detection is local and provides resources only.

**Child Safety**: We will report suspected child abuse or endangerment to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) or appropriate authorities as required by law.

**Since we don't collect user identification information, our ability to respond to legal requests is inherently limited to aggregated, anonymous data.**

### 5.4 Business Transfers

If Everyday Christian is acquired, merged, or sells assets:
- You will be notified via app update or email (if we have it)
- This Privacy Policy will continue to apply to your data
- You will have the option to delete your data before any transfer
- The acquiring party must honor these privacy commitments or obtain your explicit consent for changes

### 5.5 Data We CANNOT Share (Because We Don't Have It)

Since all data is stored locally on your device, we cannot:
- Provide your prayer journal to third parties
- Access your AI chat history
- See your Bible reading patterns
- Recover your data if you lose your device
- Transfer your data to a new device (unless you use device-level backups)

## 6. Sensitive Personal Information & Religious Data

We recognize that Everyday Christian inherently processes **sensitive personal information** under various privacy laws:

### 6.1 Types of Sensitive Data

**Religious Beliefs**: Your use of Bible reading, prayers, and AI pastoral guidance reveals your Christian faith

**Emotional and Mental Health**: Questions about anxiety, depression, grief, anger, or other struggles shared in AI chat

**Personal Circumstances**: Information about relationships, family matters, financial struggles, or life challenges mentioned in prayers or chat

**Crisis Content**: Messages containing references to suicide, self-harm, abuse, or trauma

### 6.2 Special Protections for Sensitive Data

**Local Storage**: All sensitive data remains on your device, minimizing exposure risk

**Anonymous API Calls**: When using Premium AI chat, your messages are sent to Google without your identity

**No Profiling**: We do not build profiles of your religious practices, mental health patterns, or personal struggles

**No Cross-App Tracking**: We do not share data with other apps or use it for targeted advertising

**Biometric Protection**: You can enable additional security layers to protect access to sensitive content

**Crisis Intervention**: Crisis content triggers local safety resources without logging or transmitting the specific content

### 6.3 Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR Compliance)

For users in the European Union or European Economic Area, our legal basis for processing religious and sensitive data is:

**Explicit Consent** (GDPR Article 9(2)(a)): By installing the app and using its features, you provide explicit consent to process religious data locally on your device and (for Premium users) send chat messages to Google Gemini API

**Manifest Public Interest**: Religious data processing for spiritual guidance purposes where you have made it publicly manifest through voluntary use

**You can withdraw consent at any time** by uninstalling the app or ceasing to use specific features (e.g., Premium AI chat)

### 6.4 Additional Safeguards

**No Minors Under 13**: We do not knowingly collect sensitive religious data from children under 13 without parental consent (see Section 7)

**Crisis Detection Protocols**: Automated detection of crisis content triggers professional resource recommendations

**Content Policy Enforcement**: Hate speech, abuse, and harmful content result in warnings and potential feature lockouts to protect the community

**No Discrimination**: We do not use sensitive data for discriminatory purposes or to deny services

## 7. Children's Privacy (COPPA Compliance)

Everyday Christian is designed for Christians of all ages seeking biblical guidance. However, we take special precautions regarding children's privacy under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and similar laws.

### 7.1 Age Requirements and Restrictions

**General Use (Ages 13+)**: Users 13 and older may use all app features. We recommend parental guidance for users 13-17, especially when using AI pastoral guidance.

**Children Under 13**: We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 without verifiable parental consent. Given our privacy-first, local-only architecture:
- **Free features** (Bible reading, verses, devotionals): Can be used by children under 13 without data collection concerns since all data stays on the device
- **Premium AI Chat**: Should not be used by children under 13 without parental consent due to message transmission to Google Gemini API

### 7.2 Parental Controls and Rights

**Parents and guardians of children under 13**:

**Your Rights Under COPPA**:
- Review data stored locally on your child's device by accessing the app
- Delete your child's data by clearing app data or uninstalling
- Refuse further data collection by not subscribing to Premium features
- Control your child's use of AI chat features

**How to Exercise Rights**:
1. Since data is local, you can directly access your child's device to review prayer journals, chat history, and reading activity
2. Delete all data: Settings > Clear All Data or uninstall the app
3. Disable Premium features: Cancel subscription through Apple/Google subscription settings
4. Block AI chat: Use device-level parental controls to restrict Premium purchases

**Contact for COPPA Concerns**: connect@everydaychristian.app

### 7.3 What Data We Collect from Children (If Any)

If a child under 13 uses Everyday Christian:

**With parental consent (Premium users)**:
- AI chat message text sent anonymously to Google Gemini API
- Stored locally: prayer journal, favorite verses, reading history
- No personal identifiers (name, email, birthdate) are collected

**Without parental consent (Free users)**:
- Only local device storage (prayer journal, Bible reading history)
- No data transmission to external services
- No collection of personal information

### 7.4 Parental Consent Mechanism

**To use Premium AI chat, parents of children under 13 should**:
1. Review this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service
2. Discuss appropriate use of AI spiritual guidance with your child
3. Monitor your child's subscriptions through Family Sharing (Apple) or Family Link (Google)
4. Supervise your child's use of AI chat features
5. Understand that AI guidance is not professional counseling

**We do not independently verify parental consent** beyond the parent controlling the device and subscription purchases. Parents are responsible for monitoring their children's app usage.

### 7.5 Teen Users (Ages 13-17)

**Parental Guidance Recommended**: While teens may use the app without explicit parental consent, we encourage parents to:
- Discuss the difference between AI guidance and professional counseling
- Review crisis resources with your teen (988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline)
- Monitor for signs of emotional distress
- Encourage your teen to speak with trusted adults, clergy, or counselors about serious issues
