## 🧪 Testing Focus Areas

Please test and provide feedback on:

### Critical Areas:
1. **AI Chat Functionality**
   - Send messages and verify they appear correctly
   - Check conversation history after midnight (timestamps should update)
   - Try sending messages with low device storage
   - Create new conversations and verify they save

2. **Prayer Journal**
   - Add prayers and verify timestamps
   - Check prayer dates after midnight
   - Mark prayers as answered
   - View prayer history

3. **Subscription & Trial**
   - Trial message limits (5 messages/day for 3 days)
   - Message count displays correctly
   - "Delete All Data" preserves subscription status

### General Testing:
4. **App Stability**
   - Use the app normally for 10-15 minutes
   - Try all major features (Bible, Prayer, Verses, Chat)
   - Report any crashes or freezes

5. **Performance**
   - App launch time
   - Scrolling smoothness
   - Message sending speed
   - Navigation between screens

## ✅ What Was Tested

Before this build, we ran comprehensive testing:

**Automated Tests:** ✅ 9/9 PASSED
- App launch without crashes
- Database initialization
- Network status changes
- Code fix verification

**Live Usage Testing:** ✅ 10 minutes crash-free
- Message sending & database writes
- Conversation creation
- History viewing with correct timestamps
- Zero errors detected

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

**Minor Issues (Not Blockers):**
- Some unused imports in code (cosmetic, no impact)
- 16 analyzer warnings (all non-critical)

**Intentional Limitations:**
- Trial subscription expiry detection is eventual (on next app launch), not real-time
- This is by design for privacy-first architecture
- Full expiry parsing will be added in next build before public launch

1. **What you were doing** when the issue occurred
2. **What happened** (error message, crash, unexpected behavior)

## 🚀 Next Steps

After beta testing and feedback:
